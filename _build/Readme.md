Useability and Session Based Testing
Introduction
Another site needs your expertise! This is a simple one page site that has a few different features that need your verification that they are working as intended.

You can view the website here.

Instructions
Session Based Testing
Start with some exploratory testing to get a feel for the site, documenting each of the sections you want to test.

Turn those notes into a test charter for Session Based Testing.

Set a timer for 40 minutes and execute your test charter.

Test Plan
After your Session Based Testing, you’ve received some requirements for the different fields on the site.

Odds and Evens: This field will take a string of numbers and sort them into odd and even outputs.

Filter Object: These objects can be filtered by entering any of their properties. Only objects with that property will appear in the results.

Filter String: From the listed strings, only those containing the string you input will appear in the results.

Palindrome: Click the button to see whether the string you entered is, or is not, a palindrome.

Sum: On the input lines, put in two numbers, click the button to see their sum.

Create a test plan based on these requirements, as well as enough tests to properly cover each field adequately.

Use your different test techniques

Boundary testing

Decision table testing

State transition diagrams

Etc…

Useability
Lastly, create at least 3 tests looking at the useability of the site. Consider the following questions.

Is the user experience good?

Does the site flow?

Is the site easy to use?

Does it load quickly?

Does it always give the correct answer to inputs?

Write up your findings into a test summary report as if you were sending it to a QA manager.

When you’re done
Make sure to add all of your materials to a GitHub repo.
